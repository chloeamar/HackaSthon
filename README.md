# HackaSthon

Dear students from ENSAE, CentraleSupelec and Mines de Paris, first and foremost welcome to Israel !!! We are very glad to have you here and hope that you will enjoy your trip and this particular day. 

The goal of this Hackathon is to do hand-to-mouth detection using Machine Learning or Deep Learning. More specifically, you will have to detect if someone is driking thanks to a smartwatch we built using an accelerometer. 

This is a competition but we do not expect neither you to build an AI algorithm from scratch nor to do boring stuffs. We only want you to have fun and to see how your skills can be applied in a company such as STMicroelectronics. Moreover, we decided to challenge you by asking some opened questions. There is no bad answer and we really encourage you to think completely out of the box. Be Israeli !

Since the competencies of the 3 schools are different and the level between students is heterogeneous, we will ask you both technical and qualitative questions (we do not have the answers for some of them...). \\

The topic of the challenge will be hand-to-mouth detection using Machine Learning orDeep Learning. We tried in this Hackathon to make things as simple as possible since most of the students have never studied DL. Again, do not hestitate to ask questions !


# 1st Step : Using the Board

## Building the smartwatch!


First, try to build the smartwatch and tie it to one of yours wrists.

Be careful, orientation matters.
